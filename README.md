**Crop Recommendation using Soil Properties and Weather Prediction**
This project leverages machine learning to develop an intelligent crop recommendation system. By analyzing soil properties (e.g., pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels) and weather conditions (e.g., temperature, rainfall, humidity), the system predicts the most suitable crops for specific locations, optimizing agricultural planning and productivity.

**Features**
**Data-Driven Recommendations:** Analyzes soil and weather parameters to suggest optimal crops.
**Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a Random Forest algorithm with performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) to evaluate effectiveness.
**Class Imbalance Handling:** Addresses underrepresented crop types using data balancing techniques like SMOTE.
**Visual Insights:** Includes confusion matrices and classification reports for detailed performance analysis.
**Planned Enhancements**
**Advanced Models:** Explore XGBoost and LightGBM for improved accuracy and handling class imbalances.
**Expanded Dataset:** Add diverse crop types, regions, and climate data for broader applicability.
**Feature Engineering: **Design composite features to capture complex interactions between soil and weather.
**User-Friendly Deployment:** Create mobile or web applications to deliver real-time crop recommendations.
**Use Cases**
Help farmers choose crops based on scientific analysis of their soil and local weather conditions.
Improve agricultural yield and sustainability.
Integrate with IoT systems to build smarter agricultural ecosystems.
**Technologies Used**
**Programming Language:** Python
**Libraries:** scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas
**Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
