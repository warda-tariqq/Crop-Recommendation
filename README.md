# Crop-Recommendation
Crop Recommendation using Soil Properties and Weather Prediction
This project focuses on developing an intelligent crop recommendation system using machine learning. By analyzing soil properties (e.g., pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels) and weather conditions (e.g., temperature, rainfall, humidity), the system predicts the most suitable crops for a given location.

The system leverages a Random Forest model to classify crops based on the provided dataset, which includes features related to soil quality and environmental conditions. The project highlights the strengths and limitations of machine learning for agricultural decision-making, offering insights into areas of improvement for real-world applications.
