#Crop Recommendation using Soil Properties and Weather Prediction
This project focuses on developing an intelligent crop recommendation system powered by machine learning. By analyzing critical soil properties (e.g., pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels) and weather conditions (e.g., temperature, rainfall, humidity), the system predicts the most suitable crops for a specific location, helping optimize agricultural planning and productivity.

Project Overview
The system employs a Random Forest classification model trained on a dataset that captures essential features of soil quality and environmental conditions. It highlights both the strengths and limitations of using machine learning in agricultural decision-making and offers actionable insights to enhance real-world applications.
