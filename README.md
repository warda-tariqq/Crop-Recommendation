**Crop Recommendation using Soil Properties and Weather Prediction**
This project leverages machine learning to develop an intelligent crop recommendation system. By analyzing soil properties (e.g., pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels) and weather conditions (e.g., temperature, rainfall, humidity), the system predicts the most suitable crops for specific locations, optimizing agricultural planning and productivity.The dataset is comprehensive, encompassing various key factors critical to machine learning-based crop recommendation systems. The soil properties dataset includes detailed information such as specific locations identified by latitude and longitude coordinates, soil pH, soil color, surface soil composition, electrical conductivity, and a range of soil macro and micronutrients. These factors are essential in determining the suitability of different crops to various soil types. The crop type information in the dataset primarily comprises cereals, reflecting the major crops in the regions under study.

**Features**

**Data-Driven Recommendations:** Analyzes soil and weather parameters to suggest optimal crops.

**Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a Random Forest algorithm with performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) to evaluate effectiveness.

**Class Imbalance Handling:** Addresses underrepresented crop types using data balancing techniques like SMOTE.

**Visual Insights:** Includes confusion matrices and classification reports for detailed performance analysis.


**Planned Enhancements**

**Advanced Models:** Explore XGBoost and LightGBM for improved accuracy and handling class imbalances.

**Expanded Dataset:** Add diverse crop types, regions, and climate data for broader applicability.

**Feature Engineering:**  Design composite features to capture complex interactions between soil and weather.
